# Score Based Diffusion For Graph Generative Modelling - Frontend
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the frontend of our college group mini project titled **"Score Based Diffusion For Graph Generative Modelling"**. This repository contains the code for the static web application built using ReactJS. The web application is designed to explain our proposed method and showcase the effectiveness of our trained score-based generative model for graph-structured data.


## Project Overview
#### Problem Statement
The primary problem we address in this project is to develop a trained score-based generative model for graph-structured data. This model captures intricate dependencies between nodes and edges using a graph diffusion process, which is modeled by a system of stochastic differential equations. The model preserves permutation-invariance and adheres to chemical valency rules, ensuring realistic and chemically valid generated graphs.

#### Objectives
Our project has the following objectives:
- Propose a novel score-based generative model for graph-structured data using a continuous-time framework.
- Utilize a graph diffusion process modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and innovative score matching objectives to capture complex dependencies.
- Showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model in generating realistic graphs, such as molecules, while maintaining chemical valency rules.
- Provide a static website that demonstrates the model's potential in generating intricate graphs and enables users to download model weights for their own graph generation.


## Frontend Details
#### Purpose
The frontend of our project serves as a platform to display our results and present our model architecture to users. The design principle driving the frontend development is simplicity and clarity. The website is an essential tool for showcasing the outcomes of our project and helping users understand the proposed method.

#### Features
- Basic project description: The frontend provides a brief overview of our project and its objectives.
- Download options: Users can download the trained model weights and associated pickle files from the website.
- Display of generated graphs: The website showcases the SMILES structures generated by our model, along with their corresponding graph representations.
